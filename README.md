Evolution

Copyright (c) 2019 Austin Baugh

> `Evolution` will be a 2D simulation based on Daniel Shiffman's coding challenge of implementing [Evolutionary Steering Behaviors](https://youtu.be/flxOkx0yLrY).

- This simulation is written in the Rust programming language, and uses the [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) crate.
- This simulation consists of vehicles who improve their "foraging" behaviors through the use of a genetic algorithm.
    - By "foraging" it is meant that vehicles will be inclined to consume food and avoid poison.

## Build and Run
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run`

## [Documentation](https://web.pdx.edu/~abaugh/doc/evolution)
